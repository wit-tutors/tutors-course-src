# Introduction

This lab will take you through the process of migrating your tutors-ts course web to Tutors Next. This new version can operate parallel to the tutors-ts, and can be considered an upwards compatible replacements. The Tutors-ts will remains in place and will not be retired.

Essentially, the new version no longer requires a locally installed node, tutors-ts or the local generation process (tutors-ts). Also, the process of building and uploading the published static site in 'public-site-uk' is removed, as is the need to this separate repository.

The revised approach just requires a push to the 'source' course repo - and publication will take place in the cloud triggered by each push. Moving to this system will have a number of new features not possible previously:

- Search: This is already implemented in prototype form
- Authentication: Decide if you want all or parts of your course to be public.
- Analytics: Track course usage patterns, by user if authentication enabled.

The latter 2 features are in development at the moment.

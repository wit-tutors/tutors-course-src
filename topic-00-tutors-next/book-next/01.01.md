# Introduction

This lab will take you through the process of migrating your tutors-ts course web to Tutors Next.

This new version can operate parallel to the tutors-ts, and can be considered an upwards compatible replacements. The Tutors-ts will remains in place and will not be retired.

Essentially, the new version no longer requires a locally installed node, tutors-ts or the local generation process (tutors-ts). Also, the process of managing the 'public-site-uk' is removed, as is the need to this separate repository.

The revised approach just requires a push to the 'source' course repo - and publication will take place in the cloud triggered by each push.

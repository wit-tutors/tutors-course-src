# Ignore Procedure

If you wish to hide topics - perhaps you want to develop / test material a few weeks in advance of publication, you might have been using the mbignore file to selectively release topics like this:

## mbignore
~~~
#topic-01-controllers-and-views
#topic-02-app-templates+views
#topic-03-app-models
#topic-04-arrays
topic-05-sessions
topic-06-gym-solution
~~~

In the above, all but the last two topics are published (# is like a comment out symbol).

This procedure has changed with the new system. You have a few options:

- Maintain 2 source repos, the url of one published to the students, the other private to the tuition team
- Use a git branch for future content. On Netlify, branches are also automatically deployed (see https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#branches-deploys for details).
- Use the PIN system to reveal 'ignored' topics (outlined below).

## ignore pin

You can place the following additional properties in 'properties.yaml':


## properties.yaml

~~~
ignorepin : 1213
ignore    :
# - topic-01-controllers-and-views
# - topic-02-app-templates+views
# - topic-03-app-models
# - topic-04-arrays
 - topic-05-sessions
 - topic-06-gym-solution
~~~

These entries unsure that topics 01-04 will be published be default. To reveal the final 2 topics, then PIN code can be keyed in on the course home page. You can keep this pin private, or share with your course development team.

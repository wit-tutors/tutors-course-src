# Exercises 


## Exercise 1: mbignore

For the course download in Exercise 3 above, open the file `mbignore` 

### mbignore 

~~~
#topic-01-simple
#topic-02-varied
#topic-03-media
#topic-04-units
topic-05-next
~~~

This names all of the topics - most are commented out (the '#' symbol), except the last one. Place a '#' in front of this - and rebuild the course.

You should see an additional topic. Any of the topics can be included/excluded as needed.


## Exercise 2: Private Site

Leaving the above mbignore in place, run tutors again with this flag:

~~~
tutors-ts -p
~~~

This will generate new `private-site-uk` folder. This version will include **all** topics, regardless of the contents of mbignore. 

This last scenario can be useful for selectively publishing a course for public consumption, but privately working on later, unpublished, topics.

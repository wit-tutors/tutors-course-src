# Metadata

The course structure id identical to the current format, so no change to your layout.

However, the root of the course must have the following files:

- course.md
- course.png
- properties.yaml
- package.json

You may have some of these already.

## course.md

This is just the course title, on a single line + optionally an additional short summary:

~~~text
Mobile App Development

An introduction to Mobile App Development in Android
~~~

## course.png

An image you would like to associate with the course. This will appear in the title bar on the home page.

## properties.yaml

You may already have this - if not it is no longer optional. It will contain at least the credits for the course:

~~~text
credits        : Course Authors, Affiliations, etc..
~~~

In addition, you can include links to slack, moodle, or youtube channels (optionally) which will populate a Navigation bar that will appear on all pages. e.g:

~~~text
slack          : https://wit-mobile-2018.slack.com/messages/CCR8K54J3
moodle         : https://moodle.wit.ie/course/view.php?id=126320&section=3
~~~

You can also have a link to a 'parent' course

~~~text
parent         : URL of parent course
~~~

This link will appear on the course home page, and take the student to another course (perhaps a programme home page).

## package.json

This is to trigger the build process - and should never be edited. Its contents are always:

~~~json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "tutors-json": "^1"
  }
}
~~~

# Metadata

The course structure id identical to the current format, so no change to your layout.

However, the root of the course must have the following files:

- course.md
- course.png
- properties.yaml
- package.json

You may have some of these already.


`Course.md` contains course title, on a single line + optionally an additional short summary:

## course.md

~~~yaml
Mobile App Development

An introduction to Mobile App Development in Android
~~~

## course.png

An image you would like to associate with the course. This will appear in the title bar on the home page.


You may already `properties.yaml` - if not it is no longer optional so you must include one now. It will contain at least the credits for the course:

## properties.yaml
~~~yaml
credits        : Course Authors, Affiliations, etc..
~~~

In addition, you can include links to slack, moodle, or youtube channels (optionally) which will populate a Navigation bar that will appear on all pages. e.g:

~~~yaml
slack          : https://wit-mobile-2018.slack.com/messages/CCR8K54J3
moodle         : https://moodle.wit.ie/course/view.php?id=126320&section=3
~~~

You can also have a link to a 'parent' course

~~~yaml
parent         : URL of parent course
~~~

This link will appear on the course home page, and take the student to another course (perhaps a programme home page).


To trigger the build process you will need `package.json`. This will neved have to be updated. Its contents are always:

## package.json
~~~json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "tutors-json": "^1"
  }
}
~~~

# Generate a Course

The simplest way to get started with tutors is to use the `new` command to generate a template course:

~~~
tutors-ts --new
~~~

This should respond with:

~~~
Creating new template course...
Cloning into 'tutors-starter-0'...
Next steps...
cd into tutors-starter-0 and run "tutors" again
This will generate the course web in "tutors-starter/public-site"
~~~

The command will have generated a new folder: `tutors-starter-0`, populated with a sample/template course:

Before looking at the structure of the course in detail - lets "build" the course first and look at the output from a student perspective.

Open a shell, and make sure the current directory is `tutors-starter-0`:

Then enter the `tutors-ts` command:

~~~
tutors-ts
~~~

This will respond with:

~~~
tutors-ts course web generator: 2.5.0

Tutors has now generated a complete web site from the course materials. This is populated into a `public-site-uk` folder

Opening `public-site-uk/index.html` in any browser and we see the students view of the course. It should look like this:

A version is hosted here -

- <https://wit-tutors.github.io/tutors-starter-public>

Take some time to visit all of the different resources on the site - including the toolbar along the top. See if you can relate them to the folder/file structure as laid out in tutors-starter-0 folder.

# Portfolio Example

The easiest way to explore portfolios is to have tutors generate a set of starter courses, and automatically aggregate them.

Create an empty folder - called `portfolio` below (but can be any name) - and use tutors to create three new courses:

~~~
tutors --new
tutors --new
tutors --new
~~~

~~~
iMac:portfolio edeleastar$ tutors-ts --new
tutors-ts course web generator: 2.5.0
Creating new template course...
Cloning into 'tutors-starter-0'...
Next steps...
cd into tutors-starter-0 and run "tutors" again
This will generate the course web in "tutors-starter/public-site"
iMac:portfolio edeleastar$ tutors-ts --new
tutors-ts course web generator: 2.5.0
Creating new template course...
Cloning into 'tutors-starter-1'...
Next steps...
cd into tutors-starter-1 and run "tutors" again
This will generate the course web in "tutors-starter/public-site"
iMac:portfolio edeleastar$ tutors-ts --new
tutors-ts course web generator: 2.5.0
Creating new template course...
Cloning into 'tutors-starter-2'...
Next steps...
cd into tutors-starter-2 and run "tutors" again
This will generate the course web in "tutors-starter/public-site"
iMac:portfolio edeleastar$
~~~

This will generate a folder structure like this:

Each is a standalone course, and individual `public-site-uk` folders can be generated by running tutors in each folder.

Tutors can also be run in the portfolio folder itself:

~~~
tutors-ts
tutors course web generator: 1.4.0
- tutors-starter-0
- tutors-starter-1
- tutors-starter-2
 Topic 1
 Talks:
 ....
 ....
~~~

This will generate a `public-site-uk` in as a subdirectory of portfolio:

... and this version is an aggregate of the three courses:

Each of these is an individual module - and will be linked to the publicly hosted course web as defined in the properties.yaml file in each course.

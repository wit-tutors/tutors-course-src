# Module Grouping

This is the current portfolio.yaml:

~~~
title: 'A collection of recent Modules in Modern Computer Science'
credits: 'Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT'
courseGroups:
  - title: 'Module Group Label'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-0
      - tutors-starter-1
      - tutors-starter-2
      - tutors-starter-3
      - tutors-starter-4
~~~

Change it to this:

~~~
title: 'A collection of recent Modules in Modern Computer Science'
credits: 'Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT'
courseGroups:
  - title: 'Alpha Group'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-0
      - tutors-starter-1
      - tutors-starter-2
  - title: 'Beta Group'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-3
      - tutors-starter-4
~~~

Regenerate the portfolio again. This time the portfolio home should reflect the revised grouping.

The yaml file is sensitive to column positions, so make sure you indent (with spaces) as shown in the above examples.

The summary and images are located in each course folder as:

- course.md
- course.jpg/img

In addition, credits + url are read from the properties file:

~~~
...
courseurl      : https://wit-tutors.github.io/tutors-starter-public/
credits        : Your Name, WIT
...

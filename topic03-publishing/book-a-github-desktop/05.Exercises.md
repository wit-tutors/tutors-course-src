# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Practice Updating & Publishing the Public Site

Try another edit to the source of the course to get used to the process. Remember, it will involve the following:

- Make the change to the source
- Regenerate the course (running `tutors` command in the course folder)
- Inspect the course locally first (opening public-site/index.html) to see if the changes are as expected
- Commit auto detected modifications in Github Desktop
- Sync the repository

## Exercise 2: Publish the Source to github

Currently github hosts the public-site contents only - and we are using the gh-pages facility to have the contents served as a web site.

Try creating another repo on github - this time to host the source of the course. I.e. the `tutors-starter-0` contents.

You could use the same steps we have just completed to do this. i.e.:

- drag and drop `tutors-starter-0` onto the Github desktop app
- create a new repo
- push the repo to github.

The source repo contains a file called `.gitignore` - which contains the following:

~~~
public-site
private-site
standalone-site
~~~

This excludes these subdirectories from the repo - which we are happy to do. This is the structure we can aim for:

in our `source` repo, we can use the master branch.

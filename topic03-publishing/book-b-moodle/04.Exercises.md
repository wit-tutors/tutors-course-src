## Exercise 1: New Topic

Try introducing a completely new topic into the course you have been experimenting with. Perhaps just duplicate an existing topic - but make some changes to the talk images + summaries.

Publish the course with the new topic, and also bind the published topic to a moodle topic.


## Exerise 2: Updating a Published Topic

To reinforce the nature of the binding between Moodle and gh-pages, try the following:

1. Create a new `talk` in the topic you have bound to gihub  exercise above (perhaps just duplicate an existing talk).
2. Regenerate the course using the tutors command.
3. Verify that the topic now contains the new talk.
4. Commit & Sync the repository using Github Desktop
5. Refresh the moodle topic

The last step does NOT require you to edit the topic/label in any way - we can just wait for it to fetch the updated version when the caches have timed out.

# Publishing to Moodle

Now that we have the site live - we may choose to keep Moodle as the primary gateway to our course. To do this, we would like to "import" the github hosted site into moodle - rather than replicating the material there. 

To get ready for the import, we need to make one small change to our course. In the source folder, there is a file called `courseurl`.

## courseurl

This is the default contents:

~~~
http://yourgithubname.github.io/course-title
~~~

Edit this, and replace with the actual url of your deployed course

~~~
http://[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME].github.io/[YOUR-REPO-NAME]
~~~

For instance:

~~~
http://edeleastar.github.io/tutors-starter-01
~~~

Note that the protocol in the above is `http` not `https`. This is important.

Regenerate the course via the tutors command, then commit and sync as outlined in the previous lab.

## git

Install git for your platform:

- <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

Accept all the default options if they are presented (usually just for Windows).

If the installation succeeded, then verify the version. Do this by opening a shell (command prompt on Windows) and enter the following:

~~~
git --version
~~~

You should also set your username + email in git now. These are the identifiers which will be associated with subsequent git commands. These commands are also entered in the shell:

~~~
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
~~~

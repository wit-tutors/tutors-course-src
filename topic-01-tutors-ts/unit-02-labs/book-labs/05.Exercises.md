# Exercises 

Note the title of the step - `Exercises`. This is because the full title of the step is:

- `05.Exercises.md`

In general, the labs work best if the first two characters are always a 2-digit number. However, the middle segment can be any string that makes sense. It is this middle segment that will be used in the lab menu

Try renaming the first step as follows:

- `01.01.md -> 01.Solution.md`

Regenerate the course - and the `Solution` should appear in instead of the `01` step.

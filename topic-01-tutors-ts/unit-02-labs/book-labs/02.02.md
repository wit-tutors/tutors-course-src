# Links

You can inert links to other sites directly using the markdown syntax:

~~~
[Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com)
[Github](http://github.com)
~~~

These can be as bulleted links

~~~
- [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com)
- [Github](http://github.com)
~~~

The above markdown will look like this in the lab:

- [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com)
- [Github](http://github.com)


Try these now and verify that the links appear and behave as expected.

Alternatively, you can just use html links in `<>` brackets:

~~~
- <http://github.com>
- <http://bitbucket.dom>
~~~

In fact, in Markdown you can drop out to `<html>` seamlessly if you need to.


You can also insert links to other steps:

~~~
- [Step 01](#/01)
- [Step 02](#/02)
- [Step 03](#/03)
- [Step 04](#/04)
~~~

The above should render like this:

- [Step 01](#/01)
- [Step 02](#/02)
- [Step 03](#/03)
- [Step 04](#/04)

If you try the above, then these will open other steps in the current lab.

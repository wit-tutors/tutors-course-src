# Portfolio Structure

Tutors will have generated a `portfolio.yaml` file like this:

## portfolio.yaml

~~~
title: 'A collection of recent Modules in Modern Computer Science'
credits: 'Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT'
courseGroups:
  - title: 'Module Group Label'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-0
      - tutors-starter-1
      - tutors-starter-2
~~~

This can be edited as you please - to customise the title, credits and also module groups.

Try the following as an exercise - generate 2 more starter modules:

~~~
tutors --new
tutors --new
~~~

You should have 5 starter courses now:

- tutors-starter-0
- tutors-starter-1
- tutors-starter-2
- tutors-starter-3
- tutors-starter-4

Regenerate, and inspect the portfolio home. 

Looking at `portfolio.yaml` - it will have been revised:

~~~
title: 'A collection of recent Modules in Modern Computer Science'
credits: 'Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT'
courseGroups:
  - title: 'Module Group Label'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-0
      - tutors-starter-1
      - tutors-starter-2
      - tutors-starter-3
      - tutors-starter-4
~~~

We can restructure this to express different subgroups (next step).

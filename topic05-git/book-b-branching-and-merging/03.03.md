# Merging

## What does merging mean?

In the last section, we learned about creating new branches. Often
branches are created temporarily to work on a specific piece of
work. When that work is ready, then those changes are brought back
into the original branch again.

Remember the branches from the last section? Originally there was the
 master branch, and then we created a branch called `my-new-branch`,
 where we made changes. We can now merge those changes back into
 master branch, and delete the `my-new-branch` since we won't need it
 any longer.

## What are the different types of merges in Git?

### Fast-forward merging

The simplest form of merging is *fast-forward* merging. Since branches
 are just references to commits, and `my-new-branch` is a direct
 descendant of the `master` branch; we can just update the `master`
 branch to point to the same commit as `my-new-branch`.

This is the default way that Git will merge when the target branch is
 an ancestor of the source branch. First, `checkout` the target branch
 (master in this case), and then use the `merge` subcommand to bring
 the changes from the source branch (`my-new-branch`) into this
 branch:

``` bash
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

$ git merge my-new-branch
Updating 22ba038..fa8df7e
Fast-forward
 coolfile.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 coolfile.txt
```

Now we can delete the `my-new-branch`, since we've incorporated all
 the changes into master:

```
$ git branch -d my-new-branch
Deleted branch my-new-branch (was c1e11ad).
```

### Merge commits (or *non-fast-forward* merging)

In some cases, the target branch will not be a direct ancestor of the
 source branch. Here, the default action is to create a new commit
 which has two (or more) *parent* commits.

While on the master branch, we can now merge the changes from the
 other branch as follows:

``` bash
$ git merge my-other-branch
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 importantfile.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 importantfile.txt
```

The default commit message editor will have appeared here, to give you
 the opportunity to modify the commit message for the new commit. The
 default is usually fine.

![After creating a merge commit](img/aftermergecommit1.png)

Usually a *merge commit* will not contain any changes to files itself:
 the changes will be in its ancestors. Sometimes when merging two
 divergent branches though, there will be conflicting changes on
 either side of the merge. In this case, there may be changes needed
 in the merge commit to resolve the conflicts. We'll talk about
 conflicts later.

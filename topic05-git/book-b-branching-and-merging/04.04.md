# Conflict resolution

## What are conflicts, and how do they happen?

Conflicts in Git occur when trying to integrate changes from two
 different states, where different changes are made in one place. The
 most common case is when performing a *merge* of one branch into
 another, where there's a change to a particular line in a particular
 file on both sides of the merge.

Git doesn't know what to do automatically, so it just stops in the
 middle of the action, and asks you to intervene.

## Let's cause a conflict

First, let's make a new branch
``` bash
$ git checkout -b the-left
Switched to a new branch 'the-left'

$ echo "Left is the best" >> importantfile.txt

$ git commit -am "Left is the best"
[the-left 511709c] Left is the best
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

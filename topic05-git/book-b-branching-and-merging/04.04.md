# Conflict resolution

## What are conflicts, and how do they happen?

Conflicts in Git occur when trying to integrate changes from two
 different states, where different changes are made in one place. The
 most common case is when performing a *merge* of one branch into
 another, where there's a change to a particular line in a particular
 file on both sides of the merge.

Git doesn't know what to do automatically, so it just stops in the
 middle of the action, and asks you to intervene.

## Let's cause a conflict

First, let's make a new branch and add a file:

``` bash
$ git status # Check that we've checked out master
$ git checkout -b the-left
Switched to a new branch 'the-left'

$ echo "Left is the best" >> importantfile.txt

$ git commit -am "Left is the best"
[the-left 511709c] Left is the best
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Next, for the purposes of demonstration, let's create another branch, 
called `the-right`:

```bash
# Checkout a new branch, `the-right`, from `master`
git checkout -b the-right master
Switched to a new branch 'the-right'

$ echo "Right is the best" >> importantfile.txt

$ git commit -am "Right is the best"
[the-right 511709c] Right is the best
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

We've made changes here in the same file, in two separate 
branches. If we try to integrate these branches with a merge, 
we're going to see a conflict. Let's merge `the-left` into 
`the-right` to see a conflict:

```bash
$ git merge the-left 
Auto-merging importantfile.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in importantfile.txt
Recorded preimage for 'importantfile.txt'
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

We've now got a conflict that we need to resolve before we can 
merge. Check the status of our repo:

```bash
$ git status
On branch the-right
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   importantfile.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Inspect the `diff` between these conflicting files:

```bash
$ git diff
```
```diff
diff --cc importantfile.txt
index 91fe0e5,e188c8f..0000000
--- a/importantfile.txt
+++ b/importantfile.txt
@@@ -1,2 -1,2 +1,6 @@@
  another important change
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +Right is the best
++=======
+ Left is the best
++>>>>>>> the-left
```

## How to resolve conflicts

We've got a conflict in `importantfile.txt`. Open this in an 
editor and let's walk through how to resolve this conflict.

```
another important change
<<<<<<< HEAD
Right is the best
=======
Left is the best
>>>>>>> the-left
```

We want to resolve the conflict so that we end up with an 
integrated change like the following:

```
another important change
Right and Left are both equally good
```

With our conflict manually resolved, we need to `git add`:

```
# Stage our change
git add importantfile.txt
```

Lets check our `git status` once more:

```bash
$ git status
On branch the-right
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   importantfile.txt
```

Finally, commit the integrated change:

```bash
$ git commit
# Will prompt for an $EDITOR message
Recorded resolution for 'importantfile.txt'.
[the-right d87d6f5] Merge branch 'the-left' into the-right
```

## Can I just *abort* and go back to where I was before?

Yes, you can - the `git status` command we ran earlier tells us what 
to do (`git merge --abort`)

## How to minimize the chances of conflicts

Try to keep commits small, & integrate your changes often.
